                <p>Imagine this: 2050, array of technological developments, flying cars, life at mars, tall skyscrapers, robots as inhabitants; seriously this imagination is not less than a sci-fi movie which keeps you on the edge of your seat but here comes the unexpected climax (PS: the climax might disappoint you). Here’s where the truth lies, each day the world is degrading (seriously concerned for it), no advancements have been enough to do the bare minimum for the nature globally. Currently things are on a bad track so just give a thought about the future; what will even be the situation in 2050? Will we even live in a sci-fi movie type world? Will we not be able to live the same old life again? We’ve got the majority of questions answered . How is climate change affecting it? Again, the x-factor of the growing world, climate change is expected to have majority of the impact globally in terms of each and every field covered. A lot of changes are expected to occur by 2050, from catastrophic disaster</p>

                <p>Fast fashion, something not everyone knows but once you come to know about it, you get in terms with the booming industry of fashion, where clothes are mass produced and thrown together in landfills causing so much pollution. “I need to go shopping, I don’t have clothes to wear.” “Yes, even I don’t have anything to wear, let's just go for shopping. Oh, that shop in the mall have dropped their new winter collection, which looks something we shouldn’t miss out on it!" Honestly, this small conversation feels like a very common thing we say and hear daily. The urge of shopping hits us to a different mode which just hypes up our mood. We all do love shopping a lot, hut all what we miss out commonly is that where do our old clothes go which we just throw away ruthlessly when we are just done with them. As a responsible citizen you would obviously think about the ways to get rid of fast fashion, out of which one of them is cycle up your clothes, which provides a solution being enviro</p>

                <p>Maybe a plastic bag or a bottle comes, a bunch of environmentalists might say pollution, which stands sturdy at its own place. Yes, we do relate pollution most to plastic as now gradually we have realized that the world is under constant deprivation. All we know is that plastic causes pollution, chokes up oceans, has hazardous effects on wildlife and a lot more negatives. But is plastic really bad as people say? The plastics industry manufactures polymer material  and offers services in plastics important to a range of industries, including packaging, building and construction, electronics, aerospace, and transportation. It is part of the chemical industry. The plastic industry covers a plethora of industries under it. It is one of the highest employing sectors in India and makes the highest money overall due to the constant demand in smallest of things. Where does the plastic production actually stand? It employs around 4 million people and has more than 30,000 manufacturing units in</p>

Words are less to describe the condition of world at the moment, we all have been under the constant threat of our activities without thinking about its environmental impact . One such thing is Carbon Footprints. What exactly are carbon footprints? A carbon footprint   is defined as  the total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO2). We are already known to global warming and greenhouse effect and its impact on the fast-growing world but still day-to-day things have been getting worse because of the paced development of the industrial and modern world where luxury matters over everything else. A responsible citizen should be well known to the effects of increasing carbon footprints and even doing the bare minimum can m</p>

Isn’t it?  Not really, would you ever do that in a beach which is polluted, plastic bottles lying everywhere, trash thrown at every nook and cranny, no right? We imagine beaches to be perfect because of the vivid thoughts we have about their beauty. In the growing times, we can hardly find such beaches because most of them are polluted to no extent. People come to the beaches to experience the beauty but ultimately end up ruining the charm of the beaches. The rate at which beaches are getting polluted is</p>

                <p>In the deep well of problems which are a concern for the world, there stands certainly another major issue: the decline of natural  resources .  The inter relationship between demand for natural resources and environmental problems stays at the peak of world issues for there are hardly any solutions to it. Overpopulation is the quintessential factor behind it. In simple words, the demand increases with an increase in population, ultimately causing the decline of natural resources. Natural resources are necessary to sustain life and preserving them has become extremely important. Humans assume that they are free gifts given by the environment but that’s where our mindset lacks. These are resources of nature which are finite and need to be used with utmost concern. Natural resources which are on the rapid scale of decline are: Water We think that water is a resource that doesn't need to be conserved?! Isn’t water unlimited? We can use it as much as we want, right? NO, it is certainly</p>

                <p>The age of modernization has brought a plethora of changes with it which have been beneficial for mankind. But when you flip the coin, you realize that it has been harmful to the environment.  Humans consider natural resources as earth's free gifts to us but we need to understand that resources are finite and can get exhausted soon. Using them with sustainability means ensuring that they are not being overused and there is no compromise for the future generations’ needs.  Day by day humans have become irresponsible, consequences for which we are facing already and might get worse in the future. What are some examples of human activities that affect the environment? Some of the major reasons behind the degradation of environment are: Deforestation  Deforestation is the act of cutting trees on a large scale to satisfy human needs.

                <p>Climate change is the gradual change in the climate of a specific place over time. It could be ranging from months to years depending on a plethora of factors. Climate change can also occur as an unexpected phenomena which the earth hasn’t experienced before. Earth’s climate has been changing since a long period of time, depending on internal as well as external factors.  Studies suggest that the planet's temperature has been on the constant rise due to global warming and is severely affecting the geographical, vegetative and terrain spheres of the earth. Even the smallest of a change can have a diverse effect on the planet.  Warming of Earth's climate has caused some snow and ice to melt. Moreover, it has caused oceans to rise and changed the timing of when certain plants grow. It can be caused by both- natural and man-made factors (e.g. eruption of a volcano or the carbon emissions by vehicles). Why do people think it’s a myth? Unscientific claims and facts have been enough t</p>

                <p>“Fast fashion isn’t free. Someone, somewhere is paying.”                                                                                                               — LUCY SIEGLE What comes to your mind when you first hear the word ‘fashion'?  You think of trendy, classy and a whole bunch of clothes that you would like to have.
